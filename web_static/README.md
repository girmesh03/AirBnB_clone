# 0x01. AirBnB clone - Web static

## Description.
The Web Static Airbnb Clone is a prototype website that mimics the functionality and design of the popular online lodging marketplace, Airbnb. It is designed to showcase the basic features and layout of Airbnb's website without relying on complex back-end programming or database integration.

## Usage.
To use the Web Static Airbnb Clone, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. From there, you can explore the various pages and features of the site. You can also use the command interpreter to manage your Airbnb objects and create new listings or reservations.

## Development.
The development process of the Web Static Airbnb Clone starts by creating simple HTML static pages. These pages provide the basic framework of the website and allow developers to design and layout various sections of the site. Additionally, a style guide is developed to ensure consistency across the site and to help with the creation of new pages.

The website also includes fake contents, including images, descriptions, and other elements that mimic the real Airbnb website. However, no data is loaded from external sources or databases.

One notable feature of the Web Static Airbnb Clone is that it does not use any Javascript. This simplifies the development process and enables the website to load faster. However, it also limits the functionality of the site, as some features that require Javascript may not be available.
